      <P class="container-fluid"id="box2p"><i><b>As with all writing, writing blog posts requires skill. To keep your reader interested, you should think about the structure of your piece and write appealing articles. You can help readers grasp the core concept of a post by using headings, subheadings and clear paragraphs. If people like and understand an article, they will be much more inclined to share it with others – and that will increase your rankings. So, if you want to improve your rankings, improve your writing skills. Start with these tips on how to write an SEO-friendly blog post!</b></i></P>
      <p class="container-fluid">For some, writing for SEO purposes and writing to attract and captivate your audience seem like two conflicting goals. I totally disagree. Sure, if you want a readable and SEO-friendly blog post, the words you want to be found for should be in a prominent place. But, over-using keywords severely hampers the readability of your text, which you definitely don’t want to do.</p>
      <p class="container-fluid">This post provides tips on writing blog posts that are SEO-friendly and readable. These two goals should always go hand in hand. </p>

      <p class="container-fluid"><i>Before you can start writing, you have to do keyword research. If you want to dominate the search results, you’ll just have to figure out which words your audience actually searches for. These are the topics you should write about and the words you should use in your text.</i></p>

     <div id="div3"><h2 class="container-fluid"><b>Key writing tips for SEO-friendly blog posts</b></h2></div>
     <P class="container-fluid">Above all, your blog post has to be a good piece of writing! When starting a new blog post, many bloggers just start writing, typing whatever comes into their heads. While this may work for some people who have natural writing talents, others may need some help. Personally, I always follow these ‘rules’ when blogging.</P>
